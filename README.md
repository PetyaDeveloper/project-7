# project-7
This is my 7th Teamtreehouse Techdegree Project: the javaScript here is entirely mine.
I love this project: this is a simple game: you have to guess a sentence: by guessing the letters in it:
if you get a letter right: it displays on the screen, if it is wrong, you lose one of the 5 hearts at the bottom of the screen( because
you can make only 5 mistakes before losing the game).
